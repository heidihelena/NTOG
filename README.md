# NTOG

# Nordic Collaboration for Improving Lung Cancer Research and Care

Lung cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the Nordic region, responsible for approximately 20,000 new cases and 12,000–15,000 deaths annually. It is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, accounting for the most lost life years among cancers. Despite advances in diagnostics and treatment, lung cancer prognosis still lags behind other cancer types, emphasizing the urgent need for further research and improved care strategies.

The fragmentation of lung cancer into numerous subtypes based on molecular characteristics necessitates larger patient populations for statistically sound research. By combining resources and patient data from all five Nordic countries, we can achieve sufficient numbers to conduct impactful studies, even in smaller subgroups.

# About the Nordic Thoracic Oncology Group

The Nordic Thoracic Oncology Group (NTOG) is a multidisciplinary network of lung cancer researchers and clinicians from all five Nordic countries—Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Our mission is to enhance lung cancer research and optimize patient care through strengthened collaboration across the region. By uniting our efforts, we aim to inspire and conduct multidisciplinary, cross-country comparative and collaborative research that will significantly impact lung cancer outcomes in the Nordic countries.

## Mission
Unified Platform: Serve as a common Nordic platform for national lung cancer groups and professionals dedicated to thoracic cancer care.
Improvement of Care: Enhance prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up practices for thoracic cancer.
Promotion of Research: Support and advance basic and clinical research in thoracic oncology.
Education and Training: Promote education and training in all aspects of thoracic oncology.
Collaboration and Friendship: Foster Nordic and international exchange among professionals and societies active in thoracic oncology.

## Objectives
Coordinate Clinical Trials: Facilitate collaborative clinical trials in thoracic cancers across the Nordic countries.
Organize Events: Coordinate conferences, meetings, and collaborative activities to share knowledge and best practices.
Set Standards of Care: Develop common Nordic standards for thoracic cancer care.
Establish Guidelines: Create Nordic guidelines for professional education and training in thoracic oncology.
Build Partnerships: Establish cooperation with other international, national, and regional organizations in the field.

## Membership
Any physician or researcher based in the Nordic countries and involved in thoracic oncology research or clinical care is welcome to join NTOG. Membership is free and can be obtained by contacting a member of the executive group.

# Nordic Lung Cancer Symposium 2025 or Nordic Thoracic Oncology Symposium 2025

Dates: 8th – 10th May 2025

Location: Gothenburg, Sweden

Join us for the biennial Nordic Thoracic Oncology Group (NTOG) meeting, a premier gathering of lung cancer specialists across the Nordic region.
